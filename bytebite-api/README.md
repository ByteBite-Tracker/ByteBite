Here is a list of tools used to work on this repository.

| Tool                                   | Version |
|----------------------------------------|---------|
| [Python](https://www.python.org/)      | 3.11.5  |
| [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)                                                   | 23.2.1  |

## Requirements.txt

The requirements.txt file is a text file containing the python dependencies (imports) for the project. To add to it one of 2 things can be done:

1. Delete the file and re-scan entirely with the command : pip freeze > requirements.txt 
2. Add manually to the end of the text file, ex: Django==4.2.5

Python related errors can then be solved by running the "pip install -r requirements.txt" command, this should download all python dependencies.
